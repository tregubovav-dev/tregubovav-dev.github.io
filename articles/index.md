title: "Delphi Playground: Modernizing Object Pascal"
---

Welcome to the **Delphi Playground**! This repository is a curated collection of architectural patterns, techniques, and best practices designed to modernize Object Pascal (Delphi) development. 

Our goal is to bridge the gap between legacy procedural code and modern, fluent, and thread-safe paradigms—all while maintaining the absolute zero-overhead performance that Delphi is known for.

The project is currently divided into two major series. Choose a topic below to dive in!

## Part 1: Readability, Safety, and Sustainability with Helpers

Object Pascal is famous for its readability, but legacy codebases often suffer from "The Utility Unit Problem"—deeply nested procedural calls like `QuotedStr(UpperCase(Trim(Value)))`. 

In this series, we explore how to use **Class and Record Helpers** to completely transform your code's architecture.

### 🌟 Highlights:
*   **Fluent Syntax:** Shift from passive data to active objects (`AStr.Trim.ToUpper.QuotedString`).
*   **Helper Polymorphism:** Extend base classes like `TStrings` to safely upgrade VCL/FMX components without the "Inheritance Trap."
*   **Distinct Types:** Use `type TMyInt = type Integer` to attach domain logic to primitives without conflicting with standard RTL helpers.
*   **Taming C-APIs:** Safely map sparse C-Enums, integer bitmasks, and Opaque Handles (`HKEY`, `HWND`) into clean, Object-Oriented Pascal interfaces.

## Part 2: Advanced Records, Atomics, and Smart Pointers

While Helpers are fantastic for adding syntax sugar, they cannot add state or intercept standard language operators (`:=`, `=`, `+`). When you need total control over memory layout and lifecycle management, you need **Advanced Records**.

In this series, we step beyond Helpers to build powerful, zero-overhead wrappers, lock-free thread synchronization, and automatic memory management.

### 🌟 Highlights:
*   **Zero-Overhead Wrappers:** Use Operator Overloading to make custom records behave exactly like native primitives, with zero VMT or heap allocation overhead.
*   **Safe Sets:** Fix the variable-size problem of Pascal Sets by wrapping them in fixed-size integers—perfect for strict C-Interop.
*   **Lock-Free Atomics:** Bake thread-safety directly into your types using `[Volatile]` fields and Compare-And-Swap (CAS) loops.
*   **Smart Pointers & ARC:** Utilize Delphi 10.4+ Custom Managed Records (CMR) to implement Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) and true RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) for both value types and classes.
